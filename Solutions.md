## Project Description
### Overview
- Our web application caters for people who want to have full control of their diet.
- With the help of this application, users are able to search for nutrition information of any particular food.
- We allow users to pick and manage multiple items and provide them with general statistics of their meals.
### Features
Our web application consists of 3 main views which users can navigate through by clicking the nav-bar at the top.
1. Home
- Displays aphorisms about health and diet.
2. Search
- A user can enter keywords of food they are looking for in the input box and press the button next to it. A list of results will be presented to the user and by clicking on any result, the user will see the information of the macronutrients of that item. The user can also add an item to their own list if the user has signed in.
3. Login
- User can log in with their username and password. After signing in, the user will be automatically redirected back to main page with username shown at top right corner. By clicking back to previous Login page (now MyIntake) the user can see his own list of food. Users will be allowed to manage (delete/change number of servings) from this page, and add new items to list from the search view. Users' records will be managed by date, when a user logs in, it will default to showing today's records of the user(the date based on user's machine's time).
